- **Moment.js**: For date formatting and calculations
- **Additional SonarQube API calls**: For comprehensive metrics

### Data Structure Enhancements:

```typescript
interface EnhancedReportData {
  // Existing data
  issues: Issue[];
  metrics: IssueMetrics;
  metadata: ReportMetadata;

  // New Phase 1 additions
  qualityGate: {
    status: 'PASSED' | 'FAILED' | 'NONE';
    conditions: QualityGateCondition[];
  };

  codeQuality: {
    maintainabilityRating: 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D' | 'E';
    reliabilityRating: 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D' | 'E';
    securityRating: 'A' | 'B' | 'C' | 'D' | 'E';
  };

  // Phase 2 additions
  codeMetrics: {
    coverage: number;
    duplicatedLinesDensity: number;
    linesOfCode: number;
    technicalDebt: string;
    complexity: number;
  };

  // Phase 3 additions
  securityHotspots: {
    total: number;
    byPriority: Record<string, number>;
    byCategory: Record<string, number>;
  };

  // Phase 4 additions (optional)
  trends?: {
    previousScan?: Date;
    metrics: Record<string, TrendData>;
  };
}
```
